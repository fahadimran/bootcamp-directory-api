## What I Learned in this course

This is a very comprehensive course on API development using Node.js and Express. While working on this course I learned the following concepts:

- Creating basic Node and Express server.
- Using nodemon for development of the API.
- Using Express router.
- Separating functionality into controller methods.
- Understanding how middleware works.
- Fundamentals concepts of NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
- CRUD Operations.
- Creating custom middleware.
- Extensive error handling. using custom classes and middleware.
- Learning about async/await. in Node.js.
- Using GeoJSON and MapQuest API.
- Writing a geospatial query in MongoDB.
- Learning about API concepts like pagination, sorting and filtering.
- Creating a database seeder.
- Learning how to authenticate using JWT.
- Storing JWT in cookies.
- Using concepts like aggregate in MongoDB.
- Learning how to make API secure.
- Using Postman and docgen to generate API documentation.
- Learning to deploy a full fledged API to DigitalOcean.
- Learn things like SSH and droplets, reverse proxy and nginx.
- Using Postman for testing the API and try features like collections and environments.

## API Security

Following security features are implemented in this API üîê:

- Encrypt passwords and reset tokens
- Prevent NoSQL injections
- Add headers for security (helmet)
- Prevent cross site scripting - XSS
- Add a rate limit for requests of 100 requests per 10 minutes
- Protect against http param polution
- Use cors to make API public

## Usage

**Node.js** must be installed on your machine. **npm** is automatically installed with Node.js. In order to install Node.js please visit their [Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Check Node.js version:

```
node --version
```

Check npm version:

```
npm --version
```

## Configuring the Environment

To configure the environment, follow these steps: üå≥

- In the config folder, there is a `config.env.env` starter configuration file.
- Rename the file to `config.env`.
- All the environment variables required are already present in the config file.
- Before running the application, just add your own environment variable values and you're good to go.

## Installing Dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Seeding the Database

In order to seed the database, all you have to do is run the seeder.js file using node. All data is present in the `_data` folder in json file format.

### Add records to database

Add the records i.e. bootcamps, courses, reviews and users from the `_data` folder to the database:

```
node seeder -i
```

### Remove records from database

Remove records i.e. bootcamps, courses, reviews and users from database:

```
node seeder -d
```

Now you are ready to run the application locally.

## Running Locally

Once the environment is setup and dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally.

### Run in Production Environment

Run the application in production environment:

```
npm start
```

### Run in Development Environment

In order to run the application in development mode using **nodemon**:

```
npm run dev
```

The application will start in dev mode and the server will reload once you make changes.

## Deploying to DigitalOcean

If you wish to deploy the application you have to follow the following steps:

- Create an Account on DigitalOcean. Use the affiliate link by Brad Traversy to get \$10 credit: https://m.do.co/c/5424d440c63a
- Push the respository to GitHub
- Create a droplet on DigitalOcean
- Clone the repository on the created droplet.
- Use PM2 process manager to configure server autostart and management
- Create an NGINX reverse proxy for port 80
- Connect a domain name
- Install an SSL using Let's Encrypt

For detailed guide to deploying Node.js applications to DigitalOcean please refer to this [guide](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/cd90d1ed3c462fe3bddd11bf8953a896) by Brad Traversy.

## Generating Documentation

For this project, Postman is used for testing the API. The documentation is generated as follows:

- Use Postman to create documentation of the API
- Use docgen to create HTML files from Postman collection
- Add html files as the / route for the API so the index page of the API shows the complete description of all the routes.

## Version

The project is at version **1.0**. It was built as a course project to learn about making REST APIs in Node and Express and therefore, will not be updated.
